## Why We're Building This

In Morocco, small merchants (hanout owners, wholesalers) manage customer credit the old-fashioned way: handwritten notebooks, memory, and trust. This leads to:

- **Lost revenue** - forgotten debts, unclear balances
- **Disputes** - "I paid last week!" vs "No you didn't"
- **Stress** - tracking dozens of customers manually

**Smart Karni** digitizes this process. Simple, offline-first, bilingual (Arabic/French). No accounting degree required.

## Tech Decisions

| Choice | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **React + Vite** | Fast DX, great ecosystem, easy to hire for |
| **Supabase** | Postgres + Auth + Realtime without managing servers |
| **Dexie (IndexedDB)** | Offline-first is critical - merchants need it to work anywhere |
| **TailwindCSS** | Rapid UI development, consistent design |
| **GitHub Pages** | Free, reliable, auto-deploy via Actions |
| **PWA** | Install on phone without app stores, works offline |

### Why not a native app?
- App store approval is slow and complicated
- PWA covers 90% of use cases
- One codebase for web + mobile
- Instant updates without app store review

### Why Supabase over Firebase?
- Postgres > Firestore for relational data
- Better pricing model
- Open source, can self-host later
- SQL is more flexible than NoSQL for this use case
